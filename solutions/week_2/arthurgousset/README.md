## Implementation

### Dependencies

1. Uses `rand` for random number generation to ensure the generated primes are different.
1. Uses [`primes`](https://docs.rs/primes/latest/primes/) dependency to generate prime numbers.
1. Uses `num-bigint` and `num-traits` to work with large integers.

### Learnings

Difference between `&[u64]` (borrowed slice) and `Vec<u64>` (owned vector).

### Limitations
